how to grow a mind: stastics,structure,abstraction   source URL:http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~ckemp/
  main questions:1. how does abstract knowledge guide learning and inference from sparse data?
                 2. what forms does abstract knowledge take, across different domain and tasks?
                 3. how is abstract knowledge itself acquired?
  two archetypal inductive problems:1. learning concepts 
                                    2. learning casual relations
